        <p>There are no hidden charges. You pay only the amount that you see in your order summary at the time of check
            out.</p>
        <p>If you see any charges on your credit/debit card for purchases made but you have never created an account or
            signed up, please check with your family members or business colleagues authorized to make purchases on your
            behalf. If you're still unable to recognize the charge, please report the unauthorized purchase within 30
            days of the transaction so that we can look into it. Please email us at anshusingla405gmail.com</p>
        <p>In case of a payment failure, please retry ensuring: Information passed on to payment gateway is accurate
            i.e. account details, billing address, password (for net banking), etc. Kindly also check if your Internet
            connection has been disrupted in the process.</p>
        <p>If your account has been debited after a payment failure, it is normally rolled back to your account within 7
            business days. You can email us on anshusingla405gmail.com with your order number for any clarification.</p>
